Output files from the MH_BlastSequences directory was copied to MH-gyrA, MH-gyrB, MH-parC, and MH-parE. 

The job submission files in each directory (i.e. MH-gyrA-files) was then used to grab parts of the gene sequence for alignment from each isolate and print it to one file labeled PM-gyrA.fa. The PM-gyrA.fa file was then downloaded to use in Jalview for seuqence alignment comparisons.
